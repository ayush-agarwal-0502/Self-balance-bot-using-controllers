# Self-balance-bot-using-controllers
Self balance bot made in PyBullet using PID and LQR controllers, control-dynamics project 
## Introduction 
Hi, I'm Ayush Agarwal , electronics engineering student at IIT BHU Varanasi . This is a project which I made in Control and Dynamics camp of robotics summer camp held by IIT BHU . It is based on the principles of Control Theory . The project consists of 2 self balancing bots made in pybullet , a physics simulation engine , the bots are using PID and LQR controllers respectively .
